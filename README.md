# 911 Calls 

For this capstone project, I have analyzed some 911 calls using Kaggle Data - available [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert). This project is a Data Capstone Project part of Udemy's : Python For Data Science and Machine Learning course by Jose Portilla. In this project, I test my learnings by creating interactive visualizations using different Python visualization libraries along with basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using questions as a guide when exploring. 

## Installation

Use pip or conda to install the following libraries. For conda, copy paste below on terminal   

```bash
conda install numpy   
conda install pandas   
conda install matplotlib
conda install seaborn 
```

Import the downloaded libraries on Jupyter Notebook 
``` bash 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Usage

Learn to create new features and visualizations on Python using Jupyter Notebook
